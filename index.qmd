Hey! I'm Tommy, a current first year at Pomona College. I love math and data science, and I'm excited to build upon my current knowledge in those fields. Outside of the classroom, I am a diver on Pomona-Pitzer's Swimming & Diving team. My hobbies include listening to indie music, going on long drives, and mountain biking.
